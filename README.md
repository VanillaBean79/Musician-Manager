Musician Manager CLI
The Musician Manager CLI is a simple command-line application that allows you to manage a list of musicians and their associated managers. The app allows you to create, view, update, and delete musicians and managers. It uses a SQLite database (musicians.db) to store the data.

Features
Manage Managers: Create, view, find by name, and delete managers.
Manage Musicians: Create, view all, view musicians by manager, find musicians by name, and delete musicians.
Data Storage: All data is stored in an SQLite database.
Database Structure: There are two tables: managers and musicians, where each musician is associated with a manager via manager_id.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following Python files:

manager.py: Contains functions for managing managers (add, delete, view, etc.).
musician.py: Contains functions for managing musicians (add, delete, view, etc.).
helpers.py: Contains helper functions to format manager and musician data for display.
cli.py: Main entry point for the command-line interface. Contains the logic for interacting with the user and calling functions from manager.py, musician.py, and helpers.py.
create_tables.py: Contains code to set up the SQLite database with managers and musicians tables.
